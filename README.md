# Summary Report

Given the length of the Notebook, two versions are provided:

  1) The original Python Notebook version
  2) A Zip version of the Notebook.
  
The zip file can be downloaded through the repository by clicking on the download button. This would then store the Notebook locally in order to access it directly and see its content.
